## Velocity Target

**Time Coverage:**  

- 6 subtasks → 6 working days  
- 1 subtask can fit per day to cover the 6 day period.

**Total Story Points**  

- 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 sub-story points  
    - 8 ÷ 6 days = 1.33  sub-Sprint points per day needed to complete this story.
         - Velocity = 1.33 points per Sprint 

         - Rounded-off will be 2 -sub-points target per day. Therefore, this means  1 or possibly 2 subtasks can be done in one day to cover the main task's time of 6 days.

- But the fixed time per subtask/sub-sprint is 24hours each to cover the Fixed time for Sprint 1. So 8 / 2 points = 4 -sub-sprints, therefore there will be 4 sub-sprints in a span of 24 hours. 

Note: 
Fully aware that the above context (subtask/subpoint) 
is not part of the taught content, but added it for 
context and understanding.
